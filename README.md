# ProjectEular-Solutions
In this repository, I will be uploading my solutions to the Project Euler problems. Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

Structure
Each solution will be organized by problem number in a dedicated folder, containing:

The problem statement.
The solution code (in various programming languages, if applicable).
A brief explanation of the approach used to solve the problem.
